# best-cat-toys
project completed to demonstrate front end web dev skills.
A pretend site for the BEST cat toys on the internet.

Features: 

Bootstrap Navbar with links to "Home", "Products", "About Us", "Reviews" and "Contact Us" pages. All navbar links become active both when clicking on a section or scrolling to that section so the page you are on is always highlighted on the Navbar. 

On the right side of the navbar is a lightbulb icon that will toggle dark-mode/light-mode for the whole site. 

The "Products" section features eight clickable products. Clicking on each will bring up a modal offering more info on that product and a larger image to view. Modals and grid system used are from Bootstrap. 

The "About Us" section features a read-more option that can expand or collapse some extra text 

The "Review" section features a collection of reviews. You can click the arrows to see different star ratings and reviews scroll past (or use the scrollbar)

The "Contact Us" section features a simple form. The button to submit the form will remain disabled until each section has recieved input. If the email address is (very obviously) invalid an error message will appear when you try to submit. If everything is filled in correctly, a thank you message will appear when you submit. 

The footer at the bottom has a link to my github portfolio :) 

This site was created with responsive design in mind. This site is compatible with small screens and mobile devices.
